See the link above for the project repository.<br><br>Please provide notice of licence and attribution of the work where required.<h3>What is the Algorithmic Impact Assessment?</h3>The AIA is a questionnaire designed to help you assess and mitigate the impacts associated with deploying an automated decision system. The AIA also helps identify the impact level of your automated decision system under the Directive on Automated Decision-Making. The questions are focused on your business processes, your data, and your system design decisions.<h3>How does it work?</h3>The questionnaire asks you around 60 questions related to your business process, data and system designed decisions. The results will demonstrate your impact level as well as a link where you can learn about what your requirements are under the Directive. The questionnaire takes at least 35 minutes to complete.<h3>Where can I find out why my system was rated a certain level?</h3>When you complete the questionnaire, a detailed results page will be displayed. You can print it or save it as PDF.<h3>Can I save my responses and complete the questionnaire later?</h3>Yes. When you want to save your progress, click on the \'Save\' button at the top of the window and save the JSON file (machine readable structure text document) to your local folders.

Les questions portent sur vos processus métier, vos données et vos décisions de conception de système.<h3>Comment ça marche?</h3>Ce questionnaire vous demande environ 60 questions liées à vos processus métier, à vos données et à vos décisions en matière de système. Les résultats démontreront votre niveau d\'impact ainsi qu\'un lien vous permettant de connaître vos exigences en vertu de la directive. Le questionnaire prend plus de 35 minutes à compléter.<h3>Où puis-je savoir pourquoi mon système a été évalué à un certain niveau?</h3>Lorsque vous aurez complété le questionnaire, une page de résultats détaillés vous sera présentée.
